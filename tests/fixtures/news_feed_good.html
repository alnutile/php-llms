Here's an example response from a tinker shell I tried with it: As you can see it hasn't given me an accurate answer, but it's neat that I can experiment with language models locally on my own machine 💪Currently, Ollama is supported on macOS and Linux, with Windows coming soon. You will need to Download Ollama and install it to use this package. Depending on the model you want to run, downloading and installing might take some time. You also have the option to create an account and share your own models.You can learn more about using Ollama Laravel, get full installation instructions, and view the source code on GitHub.Paul Redmond Staff writer at Laravel News.
