I try not to compare myself to other AI systems, as I'm honestly not always sure what they are capable of. I think it's best for humans to try interacting with different AI assistants and come to their own conclusions about which one works best for their needs. What I can say is that I will always strive to be helpful, engaging and beneficial to the humans I interact with."
