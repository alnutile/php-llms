But if a function is needed it would be like this:\n[\n    {\n        \"name\": \"example_function_name\",\n        \"arguments\": {\n            \"prompt\": \"The users prompt here\"\n        }\n    }\n]\nHere is a list of the function names, description and parameters for the function. IT IS OK TO RETURN EMPTY ARRAY if none are needed.\nNo extra text like \"I think it is this function\"\nThe default function the system uses will take care of anything else so if the user just wants a word or phrase search just return an empy array the default.\nDo not stray from this below list since these are the only functions the system can run other than the default one mentioned above. The below list of \nfunctions to choose from will start with ### START FUNCTION and end with ### END FUNCTION. Pleas ONLY choose from that list and return JSON OR return [] if \nnone are a fit which is ok too: \n### START FUNCTION \n name: summarize_collection, description: NOT FOR SEARCH, This is used when the prompt wants to summarize the entire collection of documents, parameters: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"prompt\":{\"description\":\"The prompt the user is using the search for.\",\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[],\"default\":\"\"}},\"required\":[\"prompt\"]} \n ###  END FUNCTION\\n### START FUNCTION \n name: search_and_summarize, description: Used to embed users prompt, search database and return summarized results., parameters: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"prompt\":{\"description\":\"This is the prompt the user is using to search the database and may or may not assist the results.\",\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[],\"default\":\"\"}},\"required\":[]} \n ###  END FUNCTION",
