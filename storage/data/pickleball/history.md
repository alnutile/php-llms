# A Brief History of Pickleball

## Origins

Pickleball, a sport that combines elements of tennis, badminton, and table tennis, has an interesting and somewhat accidental origin. The game was invented in 1965 on Bainbridge Island, Washington, by three fathers: Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Their aim was simple: to create a new game to entertain their bored children during summer vacation.

The story goes that Pritchard and Bell returned from a golf outing to find their families sitting around with nothing to do. They attempted to set up badminton, but couldn't find a full set of rackets. Improvising, they used ping-pong paddles and a perforated plastic ball, lowered the badminton net, and created the first pickleball game on an old badminton court.

## The Name

There are two competing stories about how the game got its quirky name:

1. Joan Pritchard, Joel's wife, started calling the game pickleball because "the combination of different sports reminded me of the pickle boat in crew where oarsmen were chosen from the leftovers of other boats."

2. The game was named after the Pritchards' dog, Pickles, who would chase after the ball and run away with it.

While the dog story is more popular, the Pritchard family insists that the first version is the true origin, as they didn't get the dog until a couple of years after inventing the game.

## Early Development

In the years following its invention, the three families continued to play and refine the game. They established rules, always keeping in mind the original purpose: to create a game that the whole family could play together. The first permanent pickleball court was constructed in Joel Pritchard's backyard in 1967.

By 1972, the game had grown enough in popularity that the creators decided to incorporate Pickle Ball, Inc. to protect the creation of the sport and to promote its growth.

## Spreading Across America

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, pickleball steadily gained popularity, spreading from the Pacific Northwest across the United States. It became particularly popular in retirement communities, where its low-impact nature and social aspects made it an ideal activity for seniors.

In 1984, the USA Pickleball Association (USAPA) was organized to perpetuate the growth and advancement of pickleball on a national level. The association published the first official rulebook for the sport that same year.

## Modern Era and Growing Popularity

The 21st century has seen explosive growth in pickleball's popularity:

- In 2003, pickleball was included for the first time in the Huntsman World Senior Games.
- By 2009, the game was being played in all 50 states.
- In 2010, the USAPA held the first National Tournament in Buckeye, Arizona.
- The International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was established in 2010 to promote the growth of pickleball internationally.
- By 2017, there were an estimated 2.815 million pickleball players in the United States.
- In 2021, the Sports & Fitness Industry Association named pickleball the fastest-growing sport in America for the second year in a row.
- As of 2023, there are over 4.8 million players in the US alone, with the sport continuing to grow rapidly.

## Professional Pickleball

As the sport has grown, so has its professional side:

- The first professional tournament was held in 2013.
- In 2015, the first US Open Pickleball Championships were held in Naples, Florida.
- Several professional tours have been established, including the Professional Pickleball Association (PPA) Tour and the Association of Pickleball Professionals (APP) Tour.
- Major broadcasters like ESPN and CBS Sports have begun airing professional pickleball tournaments.

## Conclusion

From its humble beginnings on a makeshift court in 1965, pickleball has grown into a global phenomenon. Its appeal lies in its accessibility, social nature, and the fact that it can be enjoyed by people of all ages and skill levels. As the sport continues to evolve and attract new players, it seems that the accidental invention of three creative dads will continue to make a significant impact on the world of sports for years to come.
