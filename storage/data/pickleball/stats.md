Pickleball statistics - the numbers behind America's fastest growing sport in 2024
Pickleball is now the fastest-growing sport in America for the third year running. The sport, which is a cross between table tennis, badminton, and tennis, was invented by three vacationers on Bainbridge Island, near Seattle, in 1965.

Pickleball is easy to learn how to play and can be enjoyed well into one’s later years, making it a popular sport among seniors.

Add to that its popular "open play format", allowing players to mix and match with dozens of others in a session, you've got a social and accessible sport that's booming in popularity.

To show you just how much the sport has taken off, we've compiled the top pickleball statistics, from player adoption to the growth rate in courts.
